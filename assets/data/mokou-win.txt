MOKOU->Oh hey, I made it down first. Would you look at that?
SUMIREKO->Wow, how'd you pick up on that so quickly!?
AYA->Do tell, Fujiawara-san!
MOKOU->Heh, sorry, it's my little secret. 
AYA->Ya got some cool confidence for such a fiery individual. You sure are a fascinatin' subject, ayaya.
SUMIREKO-> You... caught me a little rusty, I'm sure I can get you next time, Mokou!
MOKOU->Huh, you seem flustered. I didn't realize it was a race, Usami. 
SUMIREKO->I--I, uh...
MOKOU->Don't worry about it, I had fun.
AYA->I reckon I've got what I need... I'm sure you folks got places to go, and so do I.
AYA->Make sure to say hi to me when I deliver the paper tomorrow, eh? 
AYA->Don't be a stranger! 
MOKOU->I'll see you when I see ya again, I suppose. 
SUMIREKO->Wait, Mokou... You wanna get some tea in the Human Village?
MOKOU->I'm a little off-track from what I meant to do, I'll have to decline.Sorry, Usami.
SUMIREKO->... Aww, okay. Maybe next time then. So long!
MOKOU->(Maybe Sumireko isn't such a brat after all.)
