SUMIREKO->Aha, I've still got it!
MOKOU->... Yeah, I guess that was fun. 
AYA->I think I got some good shots of
ya, Usami-chan! Though I'd've loved some from bein' in front. Maybe next time!
MOKOU->Thanks for showing us the ropes, Usami. 
SUMIREKO-> Of course! It was nice to share a piece of home with someone.
AYA->I can see why it was so popular! There's something freein' about being restricted from flyin' and yet still go so fast.
AYA->Ya can feel the adrenaline of the unknown through your veins... Ayaya, I'll have lotsa fun writin' 'bout this.
MOKOU->Sorry if I seemed hesitant to try it out earlier, Usami. I'm not used to being invited to things. 
MOKOU->It was a good time.
SUMIREKO->No worries! Maybe we can do it again sometime?
MOKOU->Maybe...
AYA->Awww, how precious!
AYA->How's 'bout one more picture for the road, eh? I'll let ya take it home, as a prize!
SUMIREKO->Sure! You wanna, Mokou?
MOKOU->Yeah, that sounds nice.
AYA->Ayaya, great... Saaaaay snow!
