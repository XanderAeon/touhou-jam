AYA->Ayayaya! I can't wait to get this in the paper!
AYA->I can see it now... "HOT ACTION ON THE COOL BREEZE: SNOW BOARD THE LATEST CRAZE!"
MOKOU->Heh, can you fit all that on the front page?
AYA->Still underestimating my abilities after what I just did, eh Fujiwara-san?
AYA->Not to worry, you'll look the treat on the front page along with lil' miss Usami-chan, ayaya. 
MOKOU->Last thing I expected when I woke up today, but it was nice. 
MOKOU->I guess I can read that rag for once if I'm in it. Ha. 
AYA->Oh the casuality of those words, it pains me so. 
SUMIREKO->Can I take a photo home, Miss Aya?
AYA->I'll give it to ya tomorrow with the paper once I process 'em. How's that sound?
SUMIREKO->Okay!
AYA->See you folks later, I gotta deadline to catch!
MOKOU->I'll see ya around sometime. Maybe next time it'll be less eventful.
SUMIREKO->Hopefully so. Hehe. I'll see you. 
SUMIREKO->(I wonder what'll happen when the paper comes out tomorrow.)
SUMIREKO->(Hope it won't be too big a deal...no one reads it anyway.)
SUMIREKO->(I'll worry about it later... I should warm up with a nice drink now!)
