SUMIREKO->What a lovely sight.
SUMIREKO->(You really don't see anything like
this back home in Kanto.)
SUMIREKO->(Though there are some things I miss. I wonder...)
SUMIREKO->Ha! What a genius I am!
MOKOU->Ah, so that's what's making all this noise. And here I wanted a peaceful morning walk.
SUMIREKO->Wha--
MOKOU->Oh, it's you, the psychic girl. Usami, was it?
SUMIREKO->Y-yes... Usami Sumireko. D-did you really see all that, Mokou?
MOKOU->Hard not to, it was such an obnoxious flash.
SUMIREKO->(Aww man, I really could be more subtle.)
MOKOU->What do you have there?
SUMIREKO->Oh, this? A snowboard!
MOKOU->A... Snow Board?
SUMIREKO->Yes! It's a very popular winter sport back home. 
MOKOU->How do you play it?
SUMIREKO->You don't play it, you ride it.
MOKOU->... Ride it where?
SUMIREKO->Down a slope, of course.
MOKOU->Huh, I don't see the appeal.
SUMIREKO->(Oh, right, everyone flies in these parts, don't they?)
SUMIREKO->... I could show you if you like.
MOKOU->Hmm, I dunno, feels like I'm liable to get hurt. I really don't want to reincarnate today if it can be helped.
AYA->Ayayaya, what do we have here?
MOKOU-.Oh good, it's the local gossipmonger. 
AYA->Oh c'mon now, Fujiwara-san, I ain't that bad. 
AYA->I usually come 'round this way in first thing in the morning, and I saw you two here so I figured to say hello!
SUMIREKO->... I really didn't think I would attract so much attention today. I'm sorry. 
AYA->Aha! The famous psychic wunderkind herself, Usami Sumireko! I was wonderin' who sent out that convoluted purple magic out here.
MOKOU->What do you want?
AYA->Aww, nothin' much, just lookin' fer scoops for the Bunbunmaru Newspaper, as usual!
AYA->It's not often I get ta see the likes of Usami-chan. And what a thing she's holding, too!
SUMIREKO->You mean my snowboard?
AYA->Snow Board... How d'ya play it?
SUMIREKO->You don't play it, you ride it.
AYA->Is it a popular winter sport where you come from, Usami-chan?
SUMIREKO->Y-yes, how did you know?
AYA->Ayaya, I heard tell in the winds on the way here. Nothin' escapes the sharp tengu ears of the honorable Shameimaru Aya!
SUMIREKO->... I guess not.
AYA->Hey, Usami-chan, could you show me how it works? I've been meanin' ta get some slice-of-life shots for the paper, and this would be perfect!
SUMIREKO->I... Well... I guess I could show you. I was just telling Mokou how fun it is before you got here!
MOKOU->...
AYA-> Aww Fujiwara-san, surely ya can't turn down such an invitation from such a sweet lil' cinnamon roll.
MOKOU->(She's got no idea about our history, huh?)
AYA->You'd look real dashin' on my camera, too. Whaddaya say, huh?
MOKOU->... I guess it'd be quicker to go down the mountain this way than on foot. Why not?
AYA->Great! Ya mind conjurin' up one for me too? Understandin' things first-hand is part n' parcel of being a good reporter. 
MOKOU->You could just say you wanted to join us. 
AYA->Ayaya, I'm on the clock. I gotta ask so's I don't get in trouble.
SUMIREKO->I guess I can.
SUMIREKO->Here you go!
AYA->Much obliged!
MOKOU->Thanks. 
SUMIREKO->(Oh goodness, I might have to remember how to do actually this.)
MOKOU->Ready when you are, Usami.
AYA->Hold still you two, I'll make sure to get a good shot before we push off!
